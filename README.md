# Longest-Common-Subsequence: A comparison between Haskell and Rust implementations of the longest common subsequence (LCS) problem.

## Introduction

The longest common subsequence (LCS) problem has been around for quite sometime, and has seen interest from different fields, such as computer science and bioinformatics.  **LCS.hs** (written in Haskell) and **LCS.rs** (written in Rust) are two differing implementations of the longest common subsequence problem.  The recursive nature of **LCS.hs** and the iterative nature of **LCS.rs** demonstrate the constrasting programming paradigms and differing solutions, while achieving the same result.

## Usage

**LCS.hs** and **LCS.rs** are very easy to use
